Example explain the use of Apache Tika and Springboot

#Apache Tika
Apache Tika is a toolkit for extracting content and metadata from various types of documents, such as Word, Excel, and PDF or even multimedia files like JPEG and MP4. All text-based and multimedia files can be parsed using a common interface, making Tika a powerful and versatile library for content analysis.

Apache Tika can automatically detect the type of a document and its language based on the document itself rather than on additional information.
